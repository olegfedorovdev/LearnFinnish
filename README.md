# LearnFinnish
Game to help learning Finnish words.

You can clone it, edit words.js file and add your own words to learn there.
Then simply run index.html and it will show your words (if you add them to words.latest).
You can also add your words to a new object inside words - then just extend "select_scope" select and add your type there.
